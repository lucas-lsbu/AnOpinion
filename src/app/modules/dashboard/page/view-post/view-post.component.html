    <h1 class="text-2xl text-center border-b border-black mb-4">What can I do to improve study times at home?</h1>
    <p>So I’ve been having issues when it comes to the amount of time I am able to focus on a specific task, I’ve tried using clocks and timers but nothing seems to be going well at all.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Does anyone have any advice on how I can dedicate myself to spend more time studying a specific subject without getting bored and/or distracted and go do something else?</p>
